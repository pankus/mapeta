The 'Eastern Turkey in Asia' (IDWO 1522) is the major cartographic work for Middle Eastern geography in between the end of the 19th century and the outbreak of the First World War. The sheets – 50 in total – show much of present-day eastern Turkey, Iraq, north-western Iran, and Syria, at an unprecedented level of detail (scale 1:250,000), as well as at an adequate horizontal accuracy.
